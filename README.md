# NAHDET EL MAHROUSA - TEAM 11

A [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) web app project that provides inquiry support to Egyptian startup social entrepreneurs, whether the ideas are still in the proposals or they are facing hard decisions while running their startups.

## Background

[Nahdet El Mahrousa](https://www.nahdetelmahrousa.org/) (NM) is an Egyptian civil society organization with a mission to generate a positive and lasting impact on Egyptâ€™s cultural, social, economic and environmental development by sustainably activating and engaging Egyptian youth and social entrepreneurs. The organization is looking for providing more accessible services to more clients, especially to those who live far away from them, and to common inquiry services in a more efficient workflow. Beyond this, the organization is looking for statistical data on social entrepreneurs' frequent concerns and where to access more clients.

## Project Introduction

NM Bot is a web app that provide inquiry services in an automated fashion. End-users can "chat" with the bot by choosing answer options that describe their situation. With a series of designed questions, the bot, with a designed workflow provided by Nahdet El Mahrousa, will locate their current concern and receive advice and guidance from the organization. In the admin dashboard, NM admins can manage the bot workflow and get statistics about the behaviors of the clients, including city, their responses, and stay time.
