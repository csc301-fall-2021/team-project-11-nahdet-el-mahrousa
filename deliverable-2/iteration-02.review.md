 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

* When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
* Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Decision 1: We decided to divide the group into two smaller groups based on frontend feature implemnetation and backend feature implementation (each group has 3 members), and we divided the sprint backlog accordingly. 
This is a successful decision because comparing to the strategy of one person working across frontend and backend, this startegy allows people in the same small group to help each other better because the program structure and technology they interact with will be similar, and the other small group do not always have to be present when the one small group is having its own sprint meeting to discuss their smaller short-term goal. It also allows the members to understand better about the short term goal (when discussing in the smaller group) while having an idea about the long term goal (when discussing in the bigger group). One more important benefit for this decision is that it helps the program to better split the frontend and backend to increase encapsulation of the program.  

Decision 2: Applied github wiki for backend to organize how the api is designed and what specific goal should be met.
This is a good decision because it serves as a good standard and communication method that allows the backend member to have a unified api expectation, and it allows the frontend member to understand how to connect to the api to retrieve data. Also, it serves as a reminder for the sprint backlog for the current deliverable, allowing the backend members to remember what the goal they should achieve and what to implement.

Decision 3: Actively ask for clarification from the project partner.
This is a good decision because it can avoid any misunderstanding on the product backlog. If the product backlog is unclear or even wrong, it can result in a wrong creation of the sprint backlog and a wrong product expectation, and can eventually reuslt in a waste of time or delay in progree of the entire project.




#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Decision 1: Choosing to use messaging chat frequently instead of having frequent video meeting, in order to reduce the time for meeting and resolve problems faster.
This is not a successful decision because communicating through message chat has a few drawbacks, for example, one may not be able to receive the message or forget to reply the message, which results in a delay in communication and the progress, and some messages may not convey exactly what the sender wants to express, which can lead to missing information or even misunderstanding of the information. Also, setting up live video standup meeting frequently can also serve as a useful way of reminding people the sprint backlog and when each task should be finished.

Decision 2: At first the sprint backlog was a little too long, and we realized that some features are not necessary for the current deloverable (sprint) and some of them are more than what we can achieve in this deliverable (sprint).
This is not a successful decision because it shows that our estimate about the sprint backlog from product backlog has some inaccuracy. Having this inaccuracy will result in some members spending time on some features that can be hard to achieve in the current stage, while not leaving enough time to implement other easier but important features, which can eventually delay the project deliverable progress.

Decision 3: Each team member has been working on the specific task assigned to them individually and then modify the implementation style and structure when merging commits together.
This is not a successful decision because it is wasting a lot of time when one members implements a feature assigned to him/her in that person's own implementation style and structure, but eventually get changed completely to another one. Rather, before the members start implmenting, there should be a meeting for the group (or the smaller frontend/backend group depending on what should be implemented) to discuss and confirm a fixed structure and implementation style so the members can follow it strictly when implementing the features to save time on changing in the future.



#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why you are making a change.

Change 1: We are planning to hold more frequent stand up meeting because it allows members to communicate better with each other, help each other, come up with some implementation standard, review project progress and keep the members more motivated on finishing sprint backlog on time.


Change 2: After taking the agile lecture, we plan to spend more time discussing and evaluating the creation of sprint backlog because it will make our goal in the current sprint (deliverable) clearer and spend more time effectively on finishing goals that should be finished on the current stage.




## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

* How did you prepare your demo?
* What did you manage to demo to your partner?
* Did your partner accept the features?
* Were there change requests?
* What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
* *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*





For preparation of the demo, we have had some messaging chat meeting to discuss what should be done for the demo, and eventually we deployed the part we want to demo into a url, and we could simply use that url to demonstrate how our features work together. 
We demonstrated the bot page and bot management feature to the partner, and because we are lacking some workflow data from the partner, the admin page was not demonstrated to the partner (but we implemented it)
The partner was satisfied about how we are going so far and the partner told us that he thinks we are on the right track because we have been asking the right questions.
For now, the partner did not have any change requests for us.
We were actually having some miscommunication for the preparation of the demo, which resulted in us spending a little time to configure the data in order to demonstrate to the partner during the meeting, and that can be avoided by spending more time on the demo preparation. Threfore, one thing we learned is that we should try to set up the demo data and some configurations in advance and rehearse the workflow multiple times before doing the demo to make the demo more effective and save some time.
